About Me
--------

I have worked for the last 20 years as a Software Engineer and I am still very hands on, as you can see from my [Github Profile](https://github.com/psankar/)

Most recently, I worked as a Software Architect in VMware for the Tanzu Service Mesh product. I have tried my hands on bootstrapping a SaaS company for the last 6 months and have deferred it, for a future time frame.

I have worked in everything from Kernel filesystems performance to NextJS web usability. I identify primarily as a Go backend developer, even though I can work on all layers. I am very passionate about FOSS and been an active Opensource maintainer and contributor for the last 20 years across various projects.
